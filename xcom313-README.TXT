 -- X-Com Ufo Defense Patch --

313 Equal Terms Modification.  by Shortstop4313 and Ickschuss.
Created May 2000. Updated December 2006.

To add the patch, unzip the X-com313.zip to your Ufo defense directory and answer yes to the overwrites.  It will replace some files and add the new weapons and accompaning proper ufopedia entries.

The concept of this modification is to make some unused weapons useful again and to convert certain weapons to a real life equivilent, ie: weapons NATO would be using against these UFO attacks, from a standard 5.56 Assault Rifle, to a Squad Automatic Weapon, to a PSG-1 7.62 Nato Match grade Sniper rifle.  It also increases some explosive damages and tweaks the other damages, accuracies and fire rates for the other weapons to create some sort of game balance.

1) Powder Weapons:  While lacking the punch of Plasma and Laser weapons, the compensate for this by having the fastest fire rates in the game.  Simply, they fire more snap and auto shots per movement turn than the other weapons.  This is especially true for the Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW Machingun).

1a) Due to the change of the Autocannon to Saw, and Heavy Cannon to Sniper rifle, the HE and I rounds for both are now converted to single-shot rifle-launched muzzle-attached grenades.  The unloading of the AP rounds similates the single Blank round that is needed to be loaded into the weapon.

2) Laser Weapons: Not quite as accurate as some of the powder weapons on Aimed shots due to poor Ergonomics of the sight rails, their accuracy under the auto shot modes is exceptional and damage yields are higher than the powder weapons.  Also the lack of ammo carried makes them great for longer battles.

3) Plasma Weapon:  The pistol is slightly more potent than before and the Heavy Plasma is a bit weaker (97% of the old damage), they still are the most damaging weapons in the game.  However, I changed the accuracies, Ammo amounts and fire rates to balance the three different plasmas.  So that Heavy Plasma isn't 'The only gun you'll need to carry'.


For those using the Soldier.dat file, just move that to your save game file.  It's best to do this right at the start of the game.  Start a new Game.  Then head to the 'Sell' menu and sell off 10 of your Scientists.  This will make room for the 32 characters incoming and not cause strange errors.  Then save it, remember the save game number, then rename the 2006soldier.dat to soldier.dat and move it to "game_#" directory, the # being the number of the save game in question.  Override.
